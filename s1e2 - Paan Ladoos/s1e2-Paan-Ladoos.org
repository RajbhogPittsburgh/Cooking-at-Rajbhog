Before we get started, please take some precautions in handling food and the equipment. Food handling requires a clean workspace, clean utinsils, pots, pans, bowls, spoons, and clean hands! Equipment handling depends on the equipment. Pay attention to rotating, sharp or hot parts. Always, always read and understand the equipment user's manual before your start cooking. Haste is your enemy! 
 
Begin by placing the paan leaves and condensed milk in the chopper. Chop the ingredients until the mixture is smooth. Occaisonally, you may want to stop the chopper, open it and hand mix the ingredients to be sure all of the mixture is incorporated.
  
Heat a sauce pan to medium heat and add ghee and coconut powder. Be sure to leave some cocont powder for the final ladoo layer. Stir the mixture thoroughly. Then add the chopped paan from the chopper and mix to the consistency of pizza dough.
  
Then, move the paan dough to a mixing bowl. Let the dough cool a bit while you grease your hands. Next, take a small piece of the dough and begin rolling it in your palms to make a golf-ball sized ladoo. 
BONUS: if you want to add a surprise, flatten the ball in your palm and place a small amount of Tuti Fruti in the center. Then fold the edges to create the ball. You can also be creative and create ladoo rolls! Or, flatten the dough, then use a cookie cutter to make bite-sized pieces. Your imagination is not limited here.
 
Next, smooth out the ball in a nice ladoo shape and roll the ladoo in a bowl of coconut powder. This will make it easier to handle the ladoos.
